Shiny Purple
Main lighter purple (with black otherside)
Dark Purple

The lighter purple can act similar to a project. It might act as the the command centre. I store things in here that helps me get things done, move forward on the Quest, list things to generate ideas, and connect with the other relevant cards.

The dark purple can be used as a lower-level card. More similar to a next action. But it's not a next action, because NAs and Projects can also spawn from a Quest, and must be tied back to the originator.
